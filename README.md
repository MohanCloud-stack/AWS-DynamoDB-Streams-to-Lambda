# AWS-DynamoDB-Streams-to-Lambda
Here I have created a Lambda function and define a handler function (in python) that will respond to DynamoDB change events.

DynamoDB Streams are a powerful feature that allow applications to respond to change on your table's records. 

Combining this feature with Lambda functions creates a highly scalable and fault tolerant application that can easily respond to record modification
